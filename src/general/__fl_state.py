def processRECEvent(eventId: int, value: int, flags: int, /) -> int:
    """Processes a REC event, usually changing an automatable value.

    ## Try to achieve your task with other API functions first!

    This part of FL's scripting API is incomplete, poorly documented, and
    filled with hidden bugs. REC events expose more controls inside FL Studio,
    while being *much* more confusing than other parts of the API.

    "REC events" represent every automatable control in FL studio.
    Each "REC" is identified with a unique integer, "event ID".
    FL Studio reserves a range of event IDs for each channel, mixer track, plugin,
    and so on.

    REC events have some other properties available:

    * Descriptive name: [`device.getLinkedParamName()`][device.getLinkedParamName]

    * Current value: [`device.getLinkedValue()`][device.getLinkedValue]

    * Current value as an appropriately formatted string:
      [`device.getLinkedValueString()`][device.getLinkedValueString]

    ## HELP WANTED:
    * More information from Image-Line? More details on what `flags` can do?

    ## Args:
     * `eventId` (`int`): Refer to the [official documentation](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/midi_scripting.htm#RecEventParams)

     * `value` (`int`): value of even within a range. This range depends on the
       plugin, but you can specify for it to be between `0 - 2^30` by using the
       `midi.REC_MIDIController` flag. Note that providing an invalid value can
       lead to very strange behavior and sometimes crashes.

     * `flags` (`int`): Refer to the [official documentation](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/midi_scripting.htm#RecEventFlags)
