# Event mapping

FL Studio uses an advanced system mapping events from hardware controls to
software controls, which can be confusing to use without an explanation.

## Control IDs

These represent the unique identifier of a single hardware control within FL
Studio. They are formed from a port number, a MIDI channel and a CC number,
which are encoded as follows:

```py
cc + (channel << 16) + ((port + 1) << 22)
```

This encoding can be calculated using the `midi.EncodeRemoteControlID`
function.

## Event IDs

FL Studio maps events using event IDs, which represent the unique identifier of
a single software control. When automating these controls, event IDs are mapped
to control IDs. You can determine this link using the `device.findEventID`
function.

From this, several functions are available to interact with FL Studio using
event IDs.

* `device.getLinkedValue`: get the value associated with this event ID
* `device.getLinkedValueString`: get the value associated with this event ID as
  a string
* `device.getLinkedParamName`: get the name of the parameter linked with this
  event ID
* `device.getLinkedInfo`: get info about the parameter linked with this event
  ID
* `ui.openEventEditor`: open an event editor window for the control associated
  with this event ID
* `channels.getRecEventId`: return the base value for event IDs associated with
  this channel.
* `channels.incEventValue`: get an event value increased by a step
* `general.processRECEvent`: let FL Studio handle a change to the value of this
  event ID
